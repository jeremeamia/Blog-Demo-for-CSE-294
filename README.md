# Blog Project Demo for CSE 294 Students

This project was meant to help you learn PHP and help you see the challenges that
accompany even a small project like creating a blogging application. Hopefully you
were able to learn a lot. Here is my sample code I created at the beginning of the
semester. You may see that my code is very different from yours (for example) I have
used objects, and you were not required to. If you have any questions, feel free to
contact me.
